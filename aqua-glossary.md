# Bid

A buyer who takes part in an auction makes a **bid**. **Bids** can be canceled and in some auctions one buyer can place several **bid**

# Buyer

 Aqua can also be used for token buy-backs. In this case **buyer** is a more neutral term than investor.

# Purchase

A buyer in a fixed price sale makes a **purchase**. Do not use bid in this context.
