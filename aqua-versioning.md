# Versioning for MVP

We should use the same version for the Smartcontract and Subgraph. <- (to discuss) 

If we change things on mesa framework we should raise the minor, if only on sales level we should raise the patch level. 

The date stamp is used on release date and should be the date, or near the date as we deploy contract to chain.

Example:

0.1.0-mvp.210615

Change stuff on mesa framework:

0.2.0-mvp.210616

Change stuff on a single sale

0.2.1-mvp.210617


Loosly based on https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html


# Production ready version will be 1.0.0
